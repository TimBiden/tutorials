How To Contribute:

1. Please organize everything alphabetically. That includes topics and book names.
2. If you add a tech topic, the markup is `##` before the topic name.
3. If you add a sub-topic, the markup is `_sub-topic name_`.
4. Please add a `<br>` after the author's name to separate the link onto a new line.
5. If something is free, there is no need to designate it as such. However, if it's not free, please designate it using ` - Not Free` so people know what to expect.

In the end, it should look like this:
